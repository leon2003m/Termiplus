## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Gateway that routes Open WebUI terminal traffic to per-user Open Terminal containers, including the interactive terminal WebSocket.
- Filtering Docker socket proxy (deny by default, request bodies rebuilt from validated fields).
- Persistent and ephemeral (per-chat) storage profiles, configurable per policy.
- Terminal image based on Debian with Open Terminal and passwordless sudo, intended for gVisor or Sysbox.
- Deploy files: Docker Compose, runtime config, sandbox firewall script.
- Project standards: agent rules, security policy, contribution guide, issue and pull request templates.
- CI: lint, tests, image builds, secret and vulnerability scanning with reports, gVisor integration tests, signed releases with SBOMs.

### Security

- Gateway and socket proxy run as non-root with read-only filesystems, all capabilities dropped and `no-new-privileges`.
